Artwork And Illustrations About Connext

Connext felt like a centerpiece of a huge and vast WEB3 space. A safe space is depicted as a star giant that pulls together an array of planets (eth layers) and bridging them all along.

Artwork is made with a banner in mind and using the five main colors of connext. With two versions with or without the logos.
